Thanks to an Ancestry.com account that belonged to Backeberg’s sister, Hanson was able to review death records, census reports and “all kinds of data,” he told CNN affiliate . 
Ultimately, the detective found an out-of-state address and asked the local sheriff’s office to pay it a visit. They obliged and shortly after the visit, Hanson found himself on the phone with Backeberg for 45 minutes having a conversation he promised to keep private. 
“She had her reasons for leaving,” Hanson told WISN. 
“I think she just was removed, and you know, moved on from things and kind of did her own thing and led her life,” he added. 
CNN has reached out to the Sauk County Sheriff’s Office for comment. 
The sheriff’s office concluded Backeberg’s disappearance was her own choice and not the result of any criminal activity or foul play. 
“She sounded happy, confident in her decision, no regrets,” Hanson said.
