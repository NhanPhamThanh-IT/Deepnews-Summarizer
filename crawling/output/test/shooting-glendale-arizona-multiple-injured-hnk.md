00:55 
The fatal shooting Sunday night at a restaurant and event venue in Glendale, Arizona, was an “isolated incident that involved individuals that were known to one another,” the city manager’s office said in an update Monday. 
Three people were killed and five others were injured after a fight broke out during an event described as a “concert/car show” at El Camaron Gigante, a steak and seafood restaurant, according to Jose Miguel Santiago, a communications manager for the city of Glendale. The city is about 10 miles northwest of downtown Phoenix. 
“Once they exited the venue the fight escalated in the parking lot and that’s when these individuals began shooting at one another,” Santiago said in a statement.

The three people killed were a 17-year old boy and two 21-year-olds; the city spokesman said the teenager and one of the 21-year-olds were brothers. The city previously released the wrong age for two of the victims. 
The five people injured include two women, ages 20 and 21; two men, ages 20 and 23; and a 16-year-old boy who had surgery for his injuries and is expected to make a full recovery, the city spokesman said. 
The injuries were from gunshots or shrapnel, police said earlier.

The names of the victims will be released once next of kin are notified, Santiago said. 
The investigation is now focused on how many shooters were involved and the types of weapons they used, he said. Between 200 and 300 people were attending the event and the restaurant was open, he added. 
First responders work the scene of the shooting in the Phoenix suburb of Glendale on Sunday night.

Officers who responded to reports of a shooting around 7:45 p.m. found an “enormous scene,” police spokesperson Moroni Mendez said. 
Several people have been detained for questioning, but no suspects have been taken into custody, according to Mendez, and no officers or security personnel fired their guns. 
“We want to make sure we do a complete and thorough investigation and do right by the victims,” Mendez said. 
The shooting was among so far this year in the United States, with four or more people wounded or killed, not including shooters, according to Gun Violence Archive. 
Bystander Lupe Rodriguez described the scene to . 
“I heard people yelling out names. There was a man on the ground and it didn’t look like he made it,” Rodriguez said. “His father was yelling out his name. It was pretty bad.”
