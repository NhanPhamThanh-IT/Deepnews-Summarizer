Temple University in Philadelphia, on May 23, 2019.

At least one Temple University student has been suspended after an antisemitic incident Saturday at a Philadelphia sports bar owned by the founder of sports and pop culture website [Barstool Sports](https://www.cnn.com/2020/07/01/investing/penn-national-gaming-barstool-sports-draftkings/index.html), the school said Sunday. 
The incident began when a customer at Barstool Sansom Street ordered bottle service and a customizable sign, Barstool Sports founder Dave Portnoy said in a video posted to social media Sunday. Such a letter board is a perk that can accompany high-end beverage offerings. 
The sign read “F**k the Jews,” according to Portnoy, without saying precisely who put the message on the sign. The incident made Portnoy, who is Jewish, furious, and he immediately launched an investigation of who was responsible for the message, he said.

Portnoy said he spoke with two patrons who were responsible for the incident, and two servers at his bar who were involved have been fired. 
“The employees complied with a customer’s request for a sign in connection with ordering bottle service,” Barstool Sansom Street said in a Sunday. Photos from previous days on the bar’s page show – besides dancing, drinking and other typical club scenes – people carrying letter board signs with custom messages such as birthday greetings and other remarks. 
“We take all forms of discrimination incredibly seriously, and are particularly upset by actions taken against our Jewish patrons, colleagues, partners, and friends,” the Facebook post reads.

Temple, meanwhile, is investigating a “deeply disturbing” antisemitic incident and a student who is believed to be involved has been placed on interim suspension, its president, John Fry, said Sunday in Sunday. The letter did not describe the incident. 
The incident comes amid growing scrutiny of US universities’ handling of alleged antisemitism. Temple is that received letters from the Department of Education in March announcing an investigation into antisemitic discrimination and harassment, warning institutions of possible consequences if they don’t take adequate steps to protect Jewish students. 
“In the strongest terms possible, let me be clear: antisemitism is abhorrent. It has no place at Temple and acts of hatred and discrimination against any person or persons are not tolerated at this university,” Fry said. 
CNN reached out to Temple University for additional information. 
Portnoy has decided to “use this as a teaching moment, not just for (those involved), but maybe for everyone,” he said in a second video about the incident. He spoke to the two patrons’ families and is paying for the men to visit Auschwitz, the Nazi concentration camp in Poland now operating as a museum preserving the horrors of the Holocaust. 
“The more I thought about it, it’s like, these are young f**king morons who did this, drunk,” he said. “It’s like, do you really want to ruin someone’s life?” 
Portnoy said he believes sending them on a trip to Auschwitz is “a fair outcome of this event.” 
Portnoy founded the site and media company Barstool Sports in [2003](https://www.cnn.com/2020/01/29/media/barstool-penn-national-gaming/index.html) and the bar, Barstool Sansom Street, in in Center City district of Philadelphia. 
The Anti-Defamation League in Philadelphia with a statement Sunday saying, “ADL Philadelphia is aware of the offensive and hateful message “F*** the Jews” that was displayed inside Barstool, a nightlife spot on Sansom Street.” 
“We are investigating the situation and are getting in touch with the bar’s management. We have also alerted law enforcement,” the statement added. “Antisemitic slurs and statements have no place in our city.” 
Correction: A previous version of this story misspelled Barstool Sansom Street.
