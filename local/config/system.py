import asyncio

def setup_asyncio_policy():
    """
    Ensure compatibility with Windows' asyncio event loop policy.

    Description:
    -----------
    This function attempts to set the event loop policy on Windows to `WindowsProactorEventLoopPolicy`,
    which is more compatible with asynchronous I/O operations in many Windows environments, especially
    when using libraries like `asyncio`, `aiohttp`, or `FastAPI`.

    Behavior:
    --------
    - Checks if the current event loop policy is not already set to `WindowsProactorEventLoopPolicy`.
    - If not, it sets the policy to `WindowsProactorEventLoopPolicy`.
    - Catches and prints a warning if the import or policy change fails due to unsupported platform,
      incorrect environment, or other issues.

    Notes:
    -----
    - This is generally only needed on Windows systems.
    - On Unix-based systems (Linux, macOS), this function has no effect and will silently fail.

    Exceptions:
    ----------
    Catches the following exceptions:
    - RuntimeError: If the event loop is already running.
    - ImportError: If `WindowsProactorEventLoopPolicy` is unavailable (e.g., non-Windows OS).
    - AttributeError: If an expected attribute does not exist.

    Example:
    --------
    >>> setup_asyncio_policy()
    [Warning] Could not set Windows asyncio policy: <Error message>  # Only if an error occurs.
    """
    try:
        from asyncio import WindowsProactorEventLoopPolicy

        if not isinstance(asyncio.get_event_loop_policy(), WindowsProactorEventLoopPolicy):
            asyncio.set_event_loop_policy(WindowsProactorEventLoopPolicy())
    except (RuntimeError, ImportError, AttributeError) as e:
        print(f"[Warning] Could not set Windows asyncio policy: {e}")
